# Challenges

+++

## A whole new language

Note:
* learning to code, learning Ruby, is like learning a foreign language, or maybe a different dialect of your own language

+++
###### The computer is a grammar nazi

![grammar nazi owls](https://media.giphy.com/media/JEIRAmTTfUgYE/giphy.gif)

Note:
* there are words that you recognise but the grammar and the syntax are all different - and if you get it wrong, the computer isn't a very forgiving native
<!-- FIXME: a tiny typo can cause an error on a different line; one missing bracket and you're hunting for ages -->

+++
###### Thinking like a programmer

![pooh bear thinking](https://media.giphy.com/media/mRh4cLIYhrs9G/giphy.gif)

Note:
* you also have to learn to think like a programmer, learn to think in the new language that you're learning
* writing pseudo code is definitely helpful for this, because then you're starting off thinking through what you want to do in your native language and then basically translating it into Ruby, but to do that you still have to get your head around the logic involved and saying it in a way that will make sure the computer has the same interpretation of it as you do, and that can be a real challenge
<!-- FIXME: you have to stop thinking like a normal person -->


+++
###### What have I done wrong!?

![computer fail](https://media.giphy.com/media/11kEuHSQAXXiGQ/giphy.gif)

Note:
* Once you've translated what you want to say into Ruby, inevitably something isn't going to work. The computer's going to say no, you're going to get an error or it's just not going to be doing what you want it to
* and it can be really hard to look at code you've written, that in your head should work - obviously you thought it would work, that's why you wrote it the way you did - it can be really hard to look at that and spot the flaw in the logic or whatever it is that's causing that error.
  * I've found that at times I really have to force myself to look at my code in a different way or from a different angle, and if I can't, the best thing I can do is to walk away from it for a while and come back and look at it anew.

+++

## What you don't know

Note:
* When you first start learning to code, there's _so much_ that you don't know

+++

###### Where do I start?

![no idea what I'm doing](https://media.giphy.com/media/xDQ3Oql1BN54c/giphy.gif)

Note:
* Can anyone else remember that feeling especially when they were first learning to code, when you're given a challenge and it's just like, where do I even start? Just feeling completely lost, almost like your brain seizes up and you're just floating there in space going "uhhhhhhhh....."

+++

###### Too many options

![lost](https://media.giphy.com/media/mPytjcsG3XS4o/giphy.gif)

Note:
* Sometimes it's not that bad, you have an idea of where to start, but then... there are options. So many options, so many choices to make.
* The first time I can remember really struggling with this was with regards to methods and classes. There was a particular assignment that we did over a couple of days where what to put into classes became the bane of my existence.

+++

###### I'll just ask Google

![google um](/images/google_um.png)

Note:
* Sometimes the challenge is knowing enough to know what you want to ask.
* That's not necessarily too bad if you're asking a human because they can help to work out with you what it is you're after,
* but if it's just between you and Google, getting to the point where you're typing in the right key words can absolutely be a challenge in iteself


+++

###### How hard can that be?

![I don't know](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Mbe4WBbmNUo2LLO/giphy.gif)

Note:
* Not really having a good idea of how hard something might be or how long it will take is something that I think all beginners struggle with,
* and it makes it difficult to make informed decisions on which way to go with something, especially when pressed for time
  * I encountered this challenge a number of times when working on creating my personal portfolio site
    * with limited time to do it I was trying for a MVP, so rather than going straight for the feature I wanted to use to present my portfolio of projects, which was basically a rotating cube with a project on each side of the cube, I went for a bootstrap carousel instead, the idea being that I could implement that quickly and then replace it with the rotating cube if I had time
    * in the end it took me about three times longer to get the carousel working than it did to create the rotating cube that I actually wanted
  * The other thing I completely misestimated was creating a contact form in rails. With no idea how to do it I thought "oh yeah that can't be too hard". Yeah nah. I was wrong.

+++

## Error messages

![rails error](/images/rails_error.png)

Note:
* Error message anxiety. This is a serious condition that I think many newbie developers suffer from. Error message pops up, eyes glaze over, and you call for help, "knowing" that you have no idea how to fix the error... and you haven't even read the error message.
  * for me the big red ones that Rails spits out were the worst
    * they're actually really helpful errors in general but they're also big and red and scary looking
* Of course even once you get past that and you force yourself to read the error, there's a difference between reading an error message and knowing what to do about it, so that becomes the next challenge

+++

## Practice

![practice](https://media.giphy.com/media/fxICg09En28tW/giphy.gif)

Note:
* Another challenge is in finding a way to practice what we've learned
  * I've found the structure of Coder Academy really good for that, because they're constantly feeding us challenges and suggestions that are tailored to where we're at and what we're learning, which really helps to consolidate our knowledge each week
  * I also try to extend upon the tasks we're given, which leads to learning further things as well as consolidating what's just been learned - and what you started with becomes the easy stuff, the "old learning" once you've extended yourself into add-ons to the project

+++

## Too many experts

![expert](https://media.giphy.com/media/F7yLXA5fJ5sLC/giphy.gif)

Note:
* As I was saying earlier there are often multiple ways to tackle a task and choosing which one can be pretty daunting. Related to that, for me, is the case of too many cooks. It's happened to me a number of times that I'll be working on something, and someone will come over and say "oh why don't you try doing it this way". Then someone else will make another suggestion, coming at it from a completely different angle. Then a third person weighs in with how they'd approach it. And the thing is, as far as I can tell they're all completely valid approaches, but what it's doing to me at that point as a newbie developer is confusing things in my head. especially because I first have to realise that they're actually different approaches to the problem, as opposed to ways to tackle it that align with the progress I've already made. And then I'm back to the challenges of deciding which option to go with, deciding whether to scrap what I've already written and try it a different way, and so on.

+++

## But I want to do good _now_

![helpful](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Mb4GkOSnCHKEi64/giphy.gif)

Note:
* Something that's not related to learning to code exactly, but is related to the experience of being a newbie developer is wanting to get in and be a part of the community, and not knowing how or whether I'm ready to do it.
* Things such as:
  * do I have anything to offer at a hackathon?
  * and how can I get into contributing to open source as a newbie developer with a fairly limited range of skills?

* If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions on that one I'd really love to hear them at the end of the presentation, because it's something I've found really difficult to work out for myself

---
# Resources

Note:
* So moving on from challenges now, let's talk briefly about resources.
* This is just my experience and me talking about what I've found useful, and I'd be really interested to hear your suggestions as well

+++

## The obvious

![obvious resources](/images/resources_obvious.png)

Note:
* So I'll start with the obvious resources for any Ruby developer
  * Google
  * Stack Overflow

  (enough said really)

  * Ruby Docs
    * kind of like the error messages... they look scary and at the start you assume you can't understand them, but once you give them a go you'll be surprised

+++

## Other online sources

![online resources](/images/resources_online.png)

Note:
* A couple of other online sources that I've found myself using repeatedly are:
  * Tutorial Point
    * which has some great overviews of how to do various things in Ruby (as well as many other languages)
  * Shortcut Foo's cheatsheets
    * they have some fantastic cheatsheets on things like Ruby Arrays, Strings, Hashes, and even things like the Atom text editor
      * they're a great easy reference point for syntax and how to do simple things that particularly as a beginner
  * Codewars
    * Codewars is awesome. I know some people hate it but I love it.
    * For anyone who hasn't come across it before it's basically an online platform where you complete coding challenges in a language of your choice and for each challenge you complete you get points and rank up on the leaderboard.
    * I've found it's a great way to do more coding than I otherwise might
      * there are a lot of really interesting challenges up there
      * and I also probably find ranking up and gaining points a bit more rewarding than I should...
        * "just gotta do one more to get over the 100 point mark..."

+++

## Social

![social resources](/images/resources_social.png)

Note:
* I think one of the best resources is actually talking to other people and listening to other people
  * Meetups
    * I've found going to meetups to be really valuable, even when 90% of the content is over my head, there's still that 10% where I'm at least getting a surface level understanding of it and it's really interesting and motivating to learn more
  * Talking to people
    * Talking to people is a great way to find things out, get introduced to new things, get new perspectives on things
  * Coder Academy
    * has really been the best resource, for me
    <!-- FIXME: say more -->

# Learning (Ruby)

Note:
* My background is in education, so naturally I see things through the eyes of an educator.
* Looking at my experience learning Ruby, I think there are three core things that make for a good learner in programming.

+++

## Be an active learner

![hugh laurie typing](https://media.giphy.com/media/cg5FwpvDmhIcM/giphy.gif)
- Actually write code |
- Break stuff |
- Seek to understand |
- Practice |

Note:

* The first thing is being an active learner.

* Being spoon-fed isn't going to get you very far - you have to really get in and do the work and figure things out for yourself

* You need to...

  * Actually write code
    * not just watch others doing it
    * and it's not enough to copy what others have done either, you need to actually create your own version, and do something different with it

  * Break stuff
    <!-- FIXME: refer to article -->

  * Seek to understand
    * It's really important to actually understand your code. When you copy and paste some code from Stack Overflow or Codepen and it works - that's awesome. But actually going that step further and really understanding how that code works, and ideally being able to reproduce it yourself, takes you a lot further in your learning.

  * Practice
    * Or in other words, use what you learn
    * Practice may not make perfect, but it does mean you won't have to start from scratch again next time

+++

## Find your interest

![moss interested - it crowd](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPnbKgN3bXeVpvy/giphy.gif)
- Love to learn |
- Make it interesting |
- Gamification |

Note:
* Love to learn
  * if you have an interest in learning for its own sake, you're automatically going to be a better learner because you're going to stop looking for a reason to learn about something and just get on and learn it instead <!-- FIXME: word this better -->
  * for me as a lifelong learner, a love of learning is one of the reasons I'm drawn to programming, because it's an area where you actually do need to keep learning constantly as part of your work

* Make it interesting
  * work on something you have an interest in means that you'll be more engaged with what you're doing, and more likely to follow the sort of tangents that can lead to better understandings and learning how to do really awesome things
    * leveraging the power of gems is, I think, a fantastic way to make really cool things very early on in your Ruby career. <!-- FIXME: say more -->

* Gamification
  * I guess gamification is really another way to make learning interesting, but I kind of feel like it deserves a point of its own.
  * The only gamification I really use regularly would be Codewars, but there are plenty of other websites and tools where you can learn or practice coding in a gamified way.

+++

## Work with others

![social it crowd](https://media.giphy.com/media/NgAzg4M6O6EtG/giphy.gif)
- Teach others |
- Learn from others |
- Share with others |
- Play with others |

Note:
<!-- FIXME: review all of this section -->
* Teach others
  * forces you to articulate your understanding, which requires you to think in different ways / think it through, leading to a deeper understanding
  * the person you are teaching it to will ask you questions, leading to avenues of the topic you may not have explored on your own

* Learn from others
  * 30 of us in the same class, exposed to the same information - we'll each
  * if you dig deep enough, (pretty much) anyone will know something you don't, or understand something better than you do
    * at the very least there will be something that they can explain to you from a different angle to your own, which will increase your understanding of the topic
  * go to meetups and talks, and actually listen and engage with them

* Share with others
  * slack
    * kind of a more passive version of "teach others"
    * also learning from others, but in a less face-to-face way

* Play (with others)
  * Codewars
  * (other things like codewars)
  * friendly competition to achieve something
