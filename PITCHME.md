# Challenges

+++

## A whole new language

+++
###### The computer is a grammar nazi

![grammar nazi owls](https://media.giphy.com/media/JEIRAmTTfUgYE/giphy.gif)

Note:
* it's like learning another language, you have to learn the grammar and the syntax - and if you get it wrong, the computer isn't very forgiving

+++
###### Thinking like a programmer

![pooh bear thinking](https://media.giphy.com/media/mRh4cLIYhrs9G/giphy.gif)

Note:
* thinking like a programmer (logic)
  * thinking within the restrictions of the language(?)
  * e.g. loops
  * getting stuck in one way of thinking / on one approach, when coming back to it later with a fresh perspective would be a better idea

+++
###### What have I done wrong!?

![computer fail](https://media.giphy.com/media/11kEuHSQAXXiGQ/giphy.gif)

Note:
* can be hard to see what you've done wrong, when what you've done makes sense to you
  * especially when you don't properly understand the syntax

+++

## What you don't know

+++

###### Where do I start?

![no idea what I'm doing](https://media.giphy.com/media/xDQ3Oql1BN54c/giphy.gif)

Note:
* not knowing where to start

+++

###### Too many options

![lost](https://media.giphy.com/media/mPytjcsG3XS4o/giphy.gif)

Note:
* too many options
    * should I make a variable? Should I make a method, a class?
      * I had a lot of trouble with methods and classes

+++

###### How hard can that be?

![I don't know](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Mbe4WBbmNUo2LLO/giphy.gif)

Note:
* not really having a good idea of how hard something might be or how long it will take
  * difficult to make informed decisions on which way to go with something, especially when pressed for time
    * encountered when working on personal portfolio project
      * e.g. creating the MVP version of a feature actually took me longer to get working than it did to create what I actually wanted (which I could have skipped straight to)
        * bootstrap carousel -> rotating cube

+++

###### I'll just ask Google

![google um](/images/google_um.png)

Note:
* not knowing enough to know how to ask Google [gif of flashing cursor in google search]

+++

## Error messages

![rails error](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MyL0V.png)

Note:
[appropriate images of error messages, gifs of panic / eyes glazing over]
* error message anxiety - eyes glazing over and not reading it ("Help!")
  * _especially_ the big red ones that Rails spits out
* (even once you get past that) there's a difference between reading an error message and knowing what to do about it

+++

## Practice

![practice](https://media.giphy.com/media/fxICg09En28tW/giphy.gif)

Note:
* finding a way to practice what we've learned
  * I've found the structure of CA good for that
    * things like Codewars are great too but they're not really targeted at what you're learning... there's a decent amount of sifting through required in order to
  * I also try to extend upon the tasks we're given, which leads to learning further things as well as consolidating what's just been learned (what you started with becomes the easy stuff, the "old learning" once you've extended yourself into add-ons to the project)

+++

## Everybody's an expert

![expert](https://media.giphy.com/media/F7yLXA5fJ5sLC/giphy.gif)

Note:
* too many expert opinions on how to do something, which all conflict... but are all equally valid... confusing the situation in my head (too many cooks)

+++

## But I want to do good _now_

![helpful](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Mb4GkOSnCHKEi64/giphy.gif)

Note:
* how can I get into contributing to open source as a newbie developer?
  * [not really relevant to learning Ruby... except that it'd be a way to practice, and it's an important part of becoming part of the community]
* do I have anything to offer at a hackathon?

## The obvious

![stack overflow](http://www.skrenta.com/images/stackoverflow.jpg)

![ruby docs](/images/ruby_docs_logo.png)

Note:
* Google
* Stack Overflow
* Ruby Docs
  * it's kind of like the error messages... they look scary and at the start you assume you can't understand them, but once you give them a go you'll be surprised

+++

Note:
* Meetups

* Coder Academy has been the best resource, for me

# Learning (Ruby)

+++

## Be an active learner

![hugh laurie typing](https://media.giphy.com/media/cg5FwpvDmhIcM/giphy.gif)
- Actually write code |
- Break stuff |
- Seek to understand |
- Practice |

Note:
Being spoon-fed isn't going to get you there - you have to figure it out for yourself

* Actually write code
  * active learning, not passive
    * don't just watch others doing it
    * don't just copy what others have done, create your own version that is in some way different

* Practice
  * Practice may not make perfect, but it does mean you won't have to start from scratch again next time

+++

## Find your interest

![moss interested it crowd](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPnbKgN3bXeVpvy/giphy.gif)
- Love to learn |
- Make it interesting |
- Gamification |

Note:
* Love to learn
  * lifelong learner
  * desire to learn

* Make it interesting
  * work on something you have an interest in
  * leveraging the power of gems

* Gamification
  * Codewars

+++

## Work with others

![social it crowd](https://media.giphy.com/media/NgAzg4M6O6EtG/giphy.gif)
- Teach others |
- Learn from others |
- Share with others |
- Play with others |

Note:
* Teach others
  * forces you to articulate your understanding, which requires you to think in different ways / think it through, leading to a deeper understanding
  * the person you are teaching it to will ask you questions, leading to avenues of the topic you may not have explored on your own

* Learn from others
  * 30 of us in the same class, exposed to the same information - we'll each
  * if you dig deep enough, (pretty much) anyone will know something you don't, or understand something better than you do
    * at the very least there will be something that they can explain to you from a different angle to your own, which will increase your understanding of the topic
  * go to meetups and talks, and actually listen and engage with them

* Share with others
  * slack
    * kind of a more passive version of "teach others"
    * also learning from others, but in a less face-to-face way

* Play (with others)
  * Codewars
  * (other things like codewars)
  * friendly competition to achieve something
