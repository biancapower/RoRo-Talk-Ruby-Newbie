# Learning (Ruby)

+++

## Be an active learner

Note:
Being spoon-fed isn't going to get you there - you have to figure it out for yourself

+++

### Actually write code
- active learning, not passive
  - don't just watch others doing it
  - don't just copy what others have done, create your own version that is in some way different

+++

### Break stuff

+++

### Seek to understand, not just copy and paste

+++

### Practice

- Practice may not make perfect, but it does mean you won't have to start from scratch again next time

---

## Find your interest

+++

### Love to learn
- lifelong learner
- desire to learn

+++

### make it interesting
- work on something you have an interest in
- leveraging the power of gems

+++

### gamification
- codewars

---

## Work with others

+++
### Teach others
- forces you to articulate your understanding, which requires you to think in different ways / think it through, leading to a deeper understanding
- the person you are teaching it to will ask you questions, leading to avenues of the topic you may not have explored on your own

+++

### Learn from others
- 30 of us in the same class, exposed to the same information - we'll each
- if you dig deep enough, (pretty much) anyone will know something you don't, or understand something better than you do
  - at the very least there will be something that they can explain to you from a different angle to your own, which will increase your understanding of the topic
- go to meetups and talks, and actually listen and engage with them

+++

### Share with others
- slack
  - kind of a more passive version of "teach others"
  - also learning from others, but in a less face-to-face way

+++

### Play (with others)
- codewars
- (other things like codewars)
- friendly competition to achieve something
