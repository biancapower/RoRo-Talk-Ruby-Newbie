Note:
What this talk is about

# Learning (Ruby)

+++

## Be an active learner

---

### Actually write code
  - active learning, not passive
    - don't just watch others doing it
    - don't just copy what others have done, create your own version that is in some way different

---

### Break stuff

---

### Seek to understand, not just copy and paste

+++

## Find your interest

---

### Love to learn
  - lifelong learner
  - desire to learn

---

### make it interesting
    - work on something you have an interest in
    - leveraging the power of gems

---

### gamification
    - codewars

+++

## Work with others

---
### Teach others
    - forces you to articulate your understanding, which requires you to think in different ways / think it through, leading to a deeper understanding
    - the person you are teaching it to will ask you questions, leading to avenues of the topic you may not have explored on your own

---

### Learn from others
    - 30 of us in the same class, exposed to the same information - we'll each
    - if you dig deep enough, (pretty much) anyone will know something you don't, or understand something better than you do
      - at the very least there will be something that they can explain to you from a different angle to your own, which will increase your understanding of the topic

---

### Share with others
    - slack
      - kind of a more passive version of "teach others"
      - also learning from others, but in a less face-to-face way

---

### Play (with others)
    - codewars
    - (other things like codewars)
    - friendly competition to achieve something
